X-ray Assistant

I developed the application during my course of improvement in radiology and diagnostic imaging, because after a wide search for a versatile and free tool, I could not find, with the practical features that I had in mind, that at the same time integrate anatomy and reporting, then go for development, in python and using as GUI wxPython.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT
I thank Robin Dunn for his work and disposition of this fantastic and intuitive cross-platform GUI toolkit for Python and Tim Roberts for their patience and readiness to answer my questions during the development of the software, because sometimes things didn't proceed as I expected.
I dedicate these words to you for the philanthropic action, free assistance and time dedication in the anonymous help that was given to me during times of difficulty: https://youtu.be/ZFOFOGV6_9E. 

The X-ray Assistant was created by the X-ray to assist doctors in issuing radiographic exam reports in an agile, versatile, customizable way. Templates based on anatomical images and voice recognition technology provided by Google API!
It is a powerful tool to help you make your x-ray reports in a structured and intelligent way.

X-RAY ASSISTANT

INTEGRATED SPEECH RECOGNITION

You can use your voice to dictate your reports. Voice recognition technology allows the computer to interpret human speech and convert it into text, so you can save your time because our Virtual Assistant will type for you. 

INTEGRATED ANATOMY

This is your new way to make your reports.
You want to report cardiomegaly for example, just click on the heart and you will have this option. Do you want to report that the joint space of the medial knee compartment is reduced? Just click on this place and you will be able to do it without typing a word, just by clicking. Remember that this option also accepts customization, because the most important thing is your way of doing things.

CUSTOMIZABLE TEMPLATES

Create your own report templates using our editor, easy to customize, your Assistant is able to learn from you!

YOUR ASSISTANT LEARNS FROM YOU
 
Through the learning system you are able to teach how you want each of your sentences to your assistant, so each time you use it you will write in your own way.
